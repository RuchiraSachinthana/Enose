With the voltage readings from two ADS1115 ADC modules:

Gather the required components:
Raspberry Pi 4
Two ADS1115 ADC modules
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
Male-to-female jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Connect the components to the Raspberry Pi as follows:
Connect the VDD pin on each ADS1115 module to the 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the GND pin on each ADS1115 module to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the SCL pin on each ADS1115 module to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g. GPIO3).
Connect the SDA pin on each ADS1115 module to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g. GPIO2).
Connect the data pin on the DHT11 sensor to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g. GPIO4).
Connect the VCC pin on the DHT11 sensor to the 3.3V pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Connect the GND pin on the DHT11 sensor to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
Note: If you're using a breadboard, you can connect the jumper wires to the components on the breadboard.

Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi:
Open the terminal and type the following command: sudo raspi-config
Select "Interfacing Options" from the menu.
Select "I2C" and choose "Yes" to enable the I2C interface.
Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
Install the necessary libraries:
Open the terminal and type the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15 adafruit-circuitpython-dht
